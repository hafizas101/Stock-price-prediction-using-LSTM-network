# Stock-price-prediction-using-LSTM-network
Stock price prediction is a very difficult but highly important task. But it can be predicted accurately by using LSTM networks. The dataset has been uploaded. It can also be download from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/historical-data/
The stock data has been visualized as follows:

Training code is 'training_code.py'. Best trained model weights are 'trained1.h5' and 'trained1.json'. The comparison between real and predicted stock values done on test dataset part is shown below:
